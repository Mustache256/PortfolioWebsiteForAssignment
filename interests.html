					<p style="text-align:center;">As you would likely expect from what I have briefly talked about on the home page of this site, video games are my main interest and passion and have been for most of my life. Therefore, I will be discussing some of my favourites<br>within this page of the site to give better insight into what I value within different game genre and what I consider to make up a good game. Hopefully this will give you an idea as to my understanding of different genres as a whole<br>and what makes games good.</p>
					<br>
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Minecraft</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Minecraft is, without a doubt, my favourite game of all time and has held that title for a very long time. If there was one game that I would consider to be perfect in almost every way, it would be minecraft, as it manages to maintain its implicity and core foundation from its inception whilst having such a degree of mechanical depth that other games can only hope of achieving. Most of this mechanical depth comes down from minecrafts crowning jewel, its building system, as it is incredibly simple to understand allowing the player to pick up one block that makes up the game world and place it in another location, but through these simple rules as to how the system works, the possible combinations of blocks you can place in any way you like create infinite possibilities and such a degree of depth that was and still is unmatched in any other video game to exist. The fact that there are no restrictions as to what combination or orientation you can place most blocks within the game is what makes minecraft so great. this rule again follows with the way the game worlds are created in minecraft, by outlining each part of the world as an individual block givves infinite possibilities as to what the world can be like, each world being different in layout, geometry, features, with more possibilities being added as the game continues to be developed. No matter what changes are made to the game, how much more mechanical complexity they decide to add, the core of the game remains the same, and that core is what makes minecraft the greatest game I have ever played.</p> 
					<br>
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Team Fortress 2</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is in my opinion the greatest multiplayer FPS ever made, The depths of mechanics and pure personality this game has tops every other multiplayer FPS made before and, as of writing, after TF2. Each of the 9 classes you can play has their own high skill ceiling with what a player can learn to do with them, with that depth only being added to as new weapons are added to classes, introducing new strategies and potentially even entirely different subclasses and ways to play these classes that are already steeped in such a high level of mechanical depth. As is similar to minecraft, TF2's greatness comes from its core, a core which has allowed the game to last 13 years and continue to maintain a large player base, and thats without even mentioning how much of a contribution the personality of the game has to its maintained popularity. Unfortunately, TF2's potentially has continually been squandered by its developers, however that is even more of a testament to how incredible this game is that it has still managed to maintain popularity amongst players despite its mishandled development by Valve, and I continue to hope that valve will realise just how great TF2 could be and start working towards that greatness.</p>
