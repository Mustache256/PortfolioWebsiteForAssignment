						<td id="td2" style="text-align: center;"><br><b>Overview description from design document:</b> 1 v 1 card game making use of a central card pool from which both players draw unit cards to play onto the board,<br> each player drawing 5 cards for an opening hand and 1 card for each turn thereafter. Each player will also have a set of utility cards they have selected before the<br>match, so the game isn’t entirely random. Both utility and unit cards will have a cost of “DRACHMA”, a currency gained passively over time as the game goes on.<br>Players also have heroes they play as, with these heroes having passive benefit for the player. The utility card and heroes will be themed around Greek gods, with the<br>heroes themselves being these gods (Zeus, Athena etc.). The game will therefore be framed as a battle during the ancient Greek era, with units fitting that theme.<br>There is also a 3rd card pile containing board effect cards that can debuff specific unit cards (condition for use?). There will also be a graveyard pile for units<br>that have been killed, potentially used for additional gameplay elements. This graveyard pile will contain dead units from both players. Primarily a battle game.<br><br>This is a game that has been worked on by a team of 4 people for a few weeks as of 14/12/2020. It is currently at the point where we are ready for playtesting<br>of the first version of the game in order to determine how much of the game needs to be changed and what needs to be balanced. I will update this page<br>once we are further along in development, however for now I will display some of a mockup of what the cards might look like in the final version of the game.<br><br><br><img src="images/cardmockup.png"><br><br></td>

					<tr>
						<td id="td1" style="width:25%; font-size:30;">Blackjack using C++</td>
						<td id="td2" style="text-align: center;"><br>This is a project that is as a result of an assignment that has been set to me within my current university degree. Over the course of the last few months, I have been<br>learning C++ through my uni course, with this project being the accumulation of these months of work. The game will be a carbon copy of blakcjack with all its rules,<br>likely making use of ascii characters for visual representations of the suit cards needed to play the game. The game will pit the player against the computer and<br>will not allow for players to play against other players, requiring that all the necessary information for a player to win is provided to them. Along with this, a report<br>will need to be written detailing the process of the creation of the game, including analysis and design, testing the game and conclusions made concerning<br>the game after completion.<br><br><br><img src="images/playingcards.png"><br><br></td>

					<!-- Unity Section -->

						<td id="td1" style="width:25%; font-size:30;">Learing use of unity IDE</td>
						<td id="td2" style="text-align: center;"><br>This project is very early on in its lifespan, and doesnt really have any clear end point as to when it will be complete, however my main endgoal is to feel like I have<br>a substantial understanding of unity and how to use it in game creation. From this project, I will then set out more concrete goals, more than likely proceeding onto<br>the creation of a simple game within the engine. Since it is also planned for one of my next semester units to make use of unity to start working on in-engine<br>programming and game creation, this knowledge will also do well in serving that unit and my progress within it. It will also allow me to catch any bad mistakes I had<br>been making when teaching myself to work within the engine whilst also serving as a good foundation for future use of unity.<br><br><br><img src="images/unitylogo.png"><br><br></td>

As of time of writing,<br>I am in my first year of the degree, close to the end of the first semester, so I am beginning to establish a greater foundation of knowledge to assist me within<br>the degree in the future. Considering how early on in the degree I currently am, there isnt much else for me to describe to you, but I will return to update this<br>description when I am further on into the degree.<br><br><br><img src="images/bulogo.png"><br><br></td>
