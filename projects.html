						<td style="width:25%; text-align:top; font-size:30;">Unnamed Card-Based Board Game</td>
						<td style="text-align: center;"><b>Overview description from design document:</b> 1 v 1 card game making use of a central card pool from which both players draw unit cards to play onto the board,<br> each player drawing 5 cards for an opening hand and 1 card for each turn thereafter. Each player will also have a set of utility cards they have selected before the<br>match, so the game isn’t entirely random. Both utility and unit cards will have a cost of “DRACHMA”, a currency gained passively over time as the game goes on.<br>Players also have heroes they play as, with these heroes having passive benefit for the player. The utility card and heroes will be themed around Greek gods, with the<br>heroes themselves being these gods (Zeus, Athena etc.). The game will therefore be framed as a battle during the ancient Greek era, with units fitting that theme.<br>There is also a 3rd card pile containing board effect cards that can debuff specific unit cards (condition for use?). There will also be a graveyard pile for units<br>that have been killed, potentially used for additional gameplay elements. This graveyard pile will contain dead units from both players. Primarily a battle game.<br><br>This is a game that has been worked on by a team of 4 people for a few weeks as of 14/12/2020. It is currently at the point where we are ready for playtesting<br>of the first version of the game in order to determine how much of the game needs to be changed and what needs to be balanced. I will update this page<br>once we are further along in development, however for now I will display some of a mockup of what the cards might look like in the final version of the game.<br><br><br><img src="images/cardmockup.png"></td>
