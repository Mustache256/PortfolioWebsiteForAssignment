					<!-- Descriptions of the games -->
					<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">As you would likely expect from what I have briefly talked about on the home page of this site, video games are my main interest and passion and have been for most of my life. Therefore, I will be discussing some of my favourites<br>within this page of the site to give better insight into what I value within different game genre and what I consider to make up a good game. Hopefully this will give you an idea as to my understanding of different genres as a whole<br>and what makes games good.</p>
					<br>
					<!-- Minecraft description -->
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Minecraft</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Minecraft is, without a doubt, my favourite game of all time and has held that title for a very long time. If there was one game that I would consider to be perfect in almost every way, it would be minecraft, as it manages to maintain its implicity and core foundation from its inception whilst having such a degree of mechanical depth that other games can only hope of achieving. Most of this mechanical depth comes down from minecrafts crowning jewel, its building system, as it is incredibly simple to understand allowing the player to pick up one block that makes up the game world and place it in another location, but through these simple rules as to how the system works, the possible combinations of blocks you can place in any way you like create infinite possibilities and such a degree of depth that was and still is unmatched in any other video game to exist. The fact that there are no restrictions as to what combination or orientation you can place most blocks within the game is what makes minecraft so great. this rule again follows with the way the game worlds are created in minecraft, by outlining each part of the world as an individual block givves infinite possibilities as to what the world can be like, each world being different in layout, geometry, features, with more possibilities being added as the game continues to be developed. No matter what changes are made to the game, how much more mechanical complexity they decide to add, the core of the game remains the same, and that core is what makes minecraft the greatest game I have ever played.</p> 
					<br>
					<!-- Team Fortress 2 description -->
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Team Fortress 2</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is in my opinion the greatest multiplayer FPS ever made, The depths of mechanics and pure personality this game has tops every other multiplayer FPS made before and, as of writing, after TF2. Each of the 9 classes you can play has their own high skill ceiling with what a player can learn to do with them, with that depth only being added to as new weapons are added to classes, introducing new strategies and potentially even entirely different subclasses and ways to play these classes that are already steeped in such a high level of mechanical depth. As is similar to minecraft, TF2's greatness comes from its core, a core which has allowed the game to last 13 years and continue to maintain a large player base, and thats without even mentioning how much of a contribution the personality of the game has to its maintained popularity. Unfortunately, TF2's potentially has continually been squandered by its developers, however that is even more of a testament to how incredible this game is that it has still managed to maintain popularity amongst players despite its mishandled development by Valve, and I continue to hope that valve will realise just how great TF2 could be and start working towards that greatness.</p>

					<!-- Hades description -->
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Hades</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-aling:center;">Hades is a fantastically polished game, one of the few games I have had the pleasure of playing recently that I have considered to be a full package with little to no faults or issues that I can think of. Without question, Hades is my game of the year for 2020 as it provides so much for its price, punching way above its weight in quality and production value, beating out all the big-budget AAA titles to release in 2020. Its mechanics are perfectly crafted to grant the player incredibly well paced power escalation both in a single run, ant the upgrades you can recieve out of a run. you have a substancial amount of weapons and upgrades to unlock, acting as the progression in this rogue-lite, giving plenty of reason to keep coming back in even after you have concluded the overarching story. The characters within th egame are all fantastic, all of them being appropriate to the setting of the game, it being based off of the greek gods and goddesses, with each character having a personality that you would expect them to have if you were familiar with the mythology they come from. The artwork, voice acting and overall presentation is a delight, with every aspect of the game being hand-drawn beautifully, with nothing of the presentation being out of place. The story itself is another delight of the game, dealing with the tried and true father and son dynamic, as well as strong themes of family throughout Zagreus's interactions with his father and the other olympians that grant him th eboons throughout runs. The level of mechanical depth that you can get through the boon system is incredible, providing any number of combinations for different effects that can change how a weapon behaves within the run, giving an immense amount of replay value to the game. Overall, a perfect refinement of the Rogue-lite genre, and for me personally the best rogue-lite I have even played.</p>
					<br>
					<!-- Hollow Knight description -->
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Hollow Knight</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Hollow Knight, much like Hades, is for me the perfect MetroidVania, definitely the greatest that has been made to date in my opinion. The level of content available in this beautifully hand-drawn title is a steal for anyone interested in the genre, providing hours of entertainment for such a low cost, and again like Hades punching above its weight to be on-par with or more often than not better than its AAA counterparts. The amount of precise control you have over the player character makes combat and platform fluid, easy and fun to do, the world is designed in such a way as to give the player freedom whilst guiding them with an invisible hand to the next upgrade and area. The pwoer escalation is perfect, with all of the games enemies and bosses being challenging yet fair and fun to fight, with the game having 47 unique bosses for the player to fight. The world itself is beautifully drawn and incredible to explore, as you uncover a ruined civilisation that fell at the hand of an unknown assailant. Overall a fantastic whole package that I continue to go back to and get lost in eeven after multiple playthroughs.</p>
					<br>
					<!-- Half-Life description -->
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Half-Life</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">What game is there that is more important to the FPS genre than Half-Life, this game revolutionised how what the FPS could be, showing that an FPS could be used as a tool for telling a story that is directly integrated with the gameplay. Taking the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist working within the Black Mesa research facility that happens to get caught up in a resonance cascade event, opening the portal between earth and another dimension called Zen and allowing all the horrors it hosted to freely enther the facility and begin attacking the people working within the facility. It was teh first time any FPS has attempted to tell as story such as this, let alone putting you in the shoes of an ordinary man going about his daily life, through this creating one of the meost immersive experiences of gaming history, still beating out games in this aspect to this day, over 20 years after its release. The shining star of Half-Life is without a doubt its level and world design, which without the attention to detail and work put in to make the environments feel lived in and real to the setting it was portraying, the game would not have achieved the level of immersion it reached. Hlaf-Life is a piece of gaming history that every aspiring games creative show play at least once to make sure they have experienced that history for themselves.</p>
					<br>
					<!-- Monster Hunter: World description -->
					<h2 style="text-align:left;">Monster Hunter: World</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:bold;">____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Definitely the game within this list with the roughest edges to its experience, howevern none the less there isn't really anything out there like the Monster Hunter series. In spite of all its issues, including things like unskippable cutscenes, Monster Hunter World has one of the greatest combat systems in the business, pitting you and 3 friends against monsters of insurmountable strength that you have to strategically chip away at to slowly being to whittle down these monoliths of creatures until finally they fall, and all your work is paid off, but there is always something bigger and badder for you to deal with next. The power escalation is perfect, all the monster designs and unique and beautiful, the weapons and armour looks and feel incredible to use with there being 16 unique weapons for you to choose from, all of which behave differently from each other. Monster Hunter is a fantastic game that doesn't have an equal in its category, and provides such a high skill ceiling for each weapon available that th eamount of time you can sink into this game is well worth whatever p[rice you have to pay to get it.</p>
